Interrupting colleagues
=======================

Quinn's colleagues interrupt her all the time, so much so that she barely has
time for her own work. Analysis is the first step toward solving a problem, so
she has designed a simple program to help understand the causes of the
interruptions.

When her new program is complete, Quinn will be able to keep track of every
interruption. She will log each interruption from her command line, with the
name of the person who interrupted, the duration in minutes, and the reason for
the interruption. Something like this:

```
$ journal log ralph 10 "asked me about test reports"
$ journal log sara 5 "needed help with a SQL query"
$ journal log ralph 17 "asked me again about test reports. aargh, why won't he shut up??"
$ journal log lynn 13 "reported a bug"
```

Later, she will be able to list all the logged entries, like so:

```
$ journal list
ralph 10 "asked me about test reports"
sara   5 "needed help with SQL query"
ralph 17 "asked me again about test reports. aargh, why won't he shut up??"
lynn  13 "reported a bug"
```

She can also produce nice reports and even a hit list to show her boss.

```
$ journal total
45

$ journal hitlist
ralph 27
lynn 13
sara 5
```

Unfortunately, since Quinn is completely swamped by all the interruptions, she
has no time to actually build the program. You owe her a favor so you have
offered to do it for her.

Requirements
------------

* The program must be usable from a UNIX command line
* It must be possible to log interruptions, list logged interruptions, and get
  total interruption times by name.
* The entries must be stored in a SQL database

Quinn believes that this program will be immensely useful, so it will probably
be extended and maintained for a long time. For this reason it is important
that the code base is well-designed, clean and robust. Submit the code along
with instructions for how to setup and run the program.
